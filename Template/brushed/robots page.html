							<p>In Aerial Assist, the alliances win via getting the scoring elements (2′-diameter exercise balls) into the scoring areas located on the far end of the field. The game starts with each robot in either the White Zone (center field) or the goalie zones. They can be preloaded with 1 game ball prior to the start. The match begins with a 10-second autonomous period, where robots use the pre-programmed instructions to score points. Said points are worth 5 more during the autonomous period, and one goal will be lit up (“hot”) for each alliance. That goal is worth 5 additional points, for a maximum total of a 10 point bonus. In addition, every robot that moves from the center to their own side of the field earns another 5 point bonus. When tele-op starts, each team takes control of their respective robot, then the cycle starts and the human player transfers a ball onto the playing field. The robots can then score in the low goal, the high goal, or for 10 points pass the ball over the truss in the middle of the field. If an alliance partner can catch the ball, the alliance will earn 10 more points.</p>

							<p>Ultimate Ascent is played by two competing alliances on a flat, 27 x 54 foot field. Each Alliance consists of three robots, and they compete to score as many discs into their goals as they can during a two (2)-minute and fifteen (15)-second match. The higher the goal in which the disc is scored, the more points the Alliance receives.<br>
							The match begins with a fifteen (15)-second Autonomous Period in which robots operate independently of driver inputs. Discs scored during this period are worth additional points. For the remainder of the match, drivers control robots and try to maximize their alliance score by scoring as many goals as possible.<br>
							The match ends with robots attempting to climb up pyramids located near the middle of the field. Each robot earns points based on how high it climbs.<br>

							<p>Rebound Rumble is played by two competing alliances on a flat, 27 x 54 ft field. Each alliance consists of three robots. They compete to score as many basketballs into their hoops as they can during a 2 minute and 15 second match. The higher the hoop in which the basketball is scored, the more points the alliance receives.
							<br>
							The match begins with a 15-second Hybrid Period in which robots operate independently of driver inputs. During this Hybrid Period, one robot on each alliance may be controlled using a Microsoft Kinect. Baskets scored during this period are worth extra points. For the remainder of the match, drivers control robots and try to maximize their alliance score by scoring as many baskets as possible.
							<br>
							The match ends with robots attempting to balance on bridges located at the middle of the field. In Qualification Matches, a robot from each alliance will also try to balance on the white CoopertitionTM bridge to score additional ranking points for each alliance.

							<p>Logo Motion is the 2011 FIRST Robotics Competition game. Playing pieces are inner tubes shaped like the components of the FIRST logo. The primary objective of the game is to place them on racks to gain points. In the endgame, robots deploy smaller robots (“minibots”) to climb a tower. Minibots must be made from the FIRST Tech Challenge kit of parts. The game celebrates the 20th season of the FRC and is also meant to commemorate the artist Jack Kamen, who designed the original FIRST logo.</p>

							<p>Lunacy is the game for the 2009 FIRST Robotics Competition. Announced on January 3, 2009, the name and some of the features of the game honor the 40th anniversary of the first manned mission to the Moon (Latin: Luna). It is FRC’s 18th game. This is the first FRC competition to use the cRIO Mobile Device Controller control system from National Instruments. The driver station introduced for 2009 was the Kwikbyte DS, which was replaced in 2010 by the Classmate PC.</p>

                            <h3>The Raging Squid</h3>
							<p>Stack Attack is played on a 54-foot long by 24-foot wide playing field.  A 2-foot high platform that is 4-feet wide by 12-feet long is located across the center of the field. The platform is accessed from each of its long sides by ramps that are 8 feet long. Two alliances of two teams each compete in each match.  Each team consists of a human player, two driver/operators, and a coach. A match consists of a 10-second Human Player Period, a 15-second Autonomous Control Period, and a 1 minute and 45 second Remote Control Period.
							<br>
							The object of the game is to acquire and stack plastic storage containers that are initially located on the platform or placed on the playing field by human players. Each alliance must place containers in a scoring zone on its own side of the field to score points. The total number of points earned depends on the count of containers located in each alliance’s scoring zone multiplied by the number of containers in their highest stack. Additional points are awarded for any robot that is positioned on the top of the platform at the end of the match.</p>

							Each alliance is comprised of two teams with each team having three students and one mentor. Each team competes using one team-built robot. There are sixty (60) size 5 soccer balls.  Balls will be inflated to the manufacturer’s specifications for pressure. There are three (3) goals with castered wheels around the bases that may be moved around the playing field. All goals start equally spaced across the center of the playing field. The playing field is broken up into 5 zones.</p>

							<p>Diabolical Dynamics Each match is a maximum of two minutes long. Alliances can end the match at any time. Alliances score one point for each small ball in the goal, ten points for each large ball in the goal, ten points for each robot in the End Zone, and ten points if the stretcher is in the End Zone. The alliance doubles its score for each goal that is on the bridge if the bridge is balanced, and multiplies its score by a factor of up to three by ending the match before the two minute time limit. Each team receives the alliance score. A team multiplies its score by 1.1 if its large ball is on top of a goal. Scores are rounded up to the nearest whole point after applying all multipliers.</p>
